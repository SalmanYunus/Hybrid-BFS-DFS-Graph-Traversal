# Hybrid-BFS-DFS-Graph-Traversal

In this project, each student will be provided access to a graph comprising vertices and edges. The objective is to navigate through this graph, covering a significant portion of its nodes using BFS and DFS approaches. However, there's a twist! Rather than sticking to just one traversal method, students will combine the efficiency of BFS with the depth-first exploration of DFS.

The project is structured as follows:

### First-Half Traversal with BFS: 
Students will initiate their exploration by employing the Breadth-First Search algorithm. This method ensures that nodes are visited in levels, starting from the initial node and moving outward, exploring neighboring nodes before moving to the next level.

### Second-Half Traversal with DFS: 
Following the completion of the first phase with BFS, students will switch gears to the Depth-First Search algorithm. Unlike BFS, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, diving deep into the graph's structure.

### Traversal Order According to the English Alphabet: 
To add an additional challenge and ensure uniformity, traversal will be conducted in the order of the English alphabet. This means that nodes will be visited alphabetically, ensuring a systematic approach throughout the exploration process.

### How it works

By the end of this drill project, students will not only enhance their understanding of graph traversal algorithms but also develop a versatile approach to problem-solving, combining the strengths of different techniques for optimal results. Let's embark on this journey through the graph, traversing the nodes with precision and skill!
